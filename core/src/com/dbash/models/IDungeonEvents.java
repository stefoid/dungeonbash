//
// This interface is for telling the Dungeon about a game logic events, such as:
// - movement
// - ability use
// - change of character focus, etc...
//
// The expectation is that apart from updating the spatial relationship, these events will also have some accompanying animation
// that the caller may be interested in knowing when is finished, so a callback object is supplied.
//
// Rather than have just one function that takes an event object, we will use one function for each event.  The reason being that
// it simplifies and clarifies the calling code, and keeps the implementation of events in the Dungeon hidden.  If we used an 
// event object, the caller would have to pack the event with those parameters that were relevant, and pass it to a vague
// 'eventReceieved' type of function and the Dungeon would then have to interpret the event type and possibly translate it 
// to its own internal representation.  By using individual functions they convey exactly the event that is occurring and
// only those parameters required for that particular event are passed, clearly identifying exactly what this interface does 
// and doesn't do from looking at this file.
//
// Note also that each event has a sequence number as an indication of the order of events and also to indicate which events
// are linked.  ie. The use of an ability is one type of event, such as shooting a fireball a a target.  Linked events are
// the results of that event - creatures near the target area may take varying amount of damage - each one that does is 
// a separate event.  Linked events share the same sequence number.
//
// Also note that events that are visible and to, and played for a certain Character (lets call this a 'scene') must be 
// shown in sequence, or at the very least simultaneously.
// You cannot show an event with a higher sequence number before an event with a lower seuence number in the same scene.
//
// Other than the sequence number and callback, which are always used, events will also include a 'relevenatCharacter' parameter, 
// which could be null.  It is a hint to the Dungeon presenter as to which character's scene the event should be played in.
// This can be supplied by the game logic because each monster will either be moving randomly if it cant see a character, or it will
// be acting with purpose in response to the closest character it CAN see - which will be the 'releventCharacter' - 
// either moving towards, attacking, or running away from that character.
//
// For events that involve modifying the dungeon record, such as moving, picking up and dropping, dungeon will handle setting the positions of the 
// creatures or objects (abilities)
